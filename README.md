# Planning and Data Simulation for Pathfinding

This project demonstrates an A* Algorithm simulation for pathfinding. It shows a robot navigating a grid with obstacles from Start to Object and finally to Goal, optimizing its path in real-time. 

## Features:
- **A* Algorithm** for optimal path planning.
- **Obstacle avoidance** in the grid.
- **Dynamic trail visualization** of the robotâ€™s path.

### Technologies Used:
- Python
- Matplotlib
- NumPy
- Heapq

Feel free to explore the code and contribute!
